Source: web\n","   Title: Nuclear warfare\n","   Snippet: Nuclear warfare, also known as atomic warfare, is a military conflict or prepared political strategy that deploys nuclear weaponry. Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction; in contrast to conventional warfare, nuclear warfare can produce destruction in a much shorter time and can have a long-lasting radiological result. A major nuclear exchange would likely have long-term effects, primarily from the fallout released, and could also lead to secondary effects, such as \"nuclear winter\", nuclear famine, and societal collapse. A global thermonuclear war with Cold War-era stockpiles, or even with the current smaller stockpiles, may lead to various scenarios including human extinction. To date, the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict occurred in 1945 with the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On August 6, 1945, a uranium gun-type device (code name \"Little Boy\") was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, a plutonium implosion-type device (code name \"Fat Man\") was detonated over the Japanese city of Nagasaki. Together, these two bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 people and contributed to the surrender of Japan, which occurred before any further nuclear weapons could be deployed. After World War II, nuclear weapons were also developed by the Soviet Union (1949), the United Kingdom (1952), France (1960), and the People's Republic of China (1964), which contributed to the state of conflict and extreme tension that became known as the Cold War. In 1974, India, and in 1998, Pakistan, two countries that were openly hostile toward each other, developed nuclear weapons. Israel (1960s) and North Korea (2006) are also thought to have developed stocks of nuclear weapons, though it is not known how many. The Israeli government has never admitted nor denied having nuclear weapons, although it is known to have constructed the reactor and reprocessing plant necessary for building nuclear weapons. South Africa also manufactured several complete nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but during the 1990s, it subsequently became the first country to voluntarily destroy its domestically made weapons stocks and abandon further nuclear weapon production. Nuclear weapons have been detonated on over 2,000 occasions for testing purposes and demonstrations. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the resultant end of the Cold War, the threat of a major nuclear war between the two nuclear superpowers was generally thought to have declined. Since then, concern over nuclear weapons has shifted to the prevention of localized nuclear conflicts resulting from nuclear proliferation, and the threat of nuclear terrorism. However, the threat of nuclear war is considered to have resurged after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, particularly with regard to Russian threats to use nuclear weapons during the invasion. Since 1947, the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has visualized how close the world is to a nuclear war. The Doomsday Clock reached a high point in 1953, when the Clock was set to two minutes until midnight after the U.S. and the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs, and in 2018, following the failure of world leaders to address tensions relating to nuclear weapons and climate change issues. Since 2025, the Clock has been set at 89 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been. The 2023 advance of the Clock's time setting was largely attributed to the risk of nuclear escalation that arose from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n","   Direct Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare\n","   Timestamp: 2025-08-15T16:56:30.311515\n","\n","2.

This new underwater 2d ww arcade may change your opinion about atom uboats and marine lifestyle, because you’ll have to deal with naval warfare and destroy military ships. Your guess is correct – operating a 2d sub, an atom uboat or a battleship is very hard!\n","\n","Be that very captain of a submarine armada and reflect the blows of Chernobyl armada enemies! Sink their armada, ships, uboats, warships and battleships!\n","\n","You will have to operate all the parts of your sub:\n","An inner hull, which protects the crew from the water pressing, and an outer hull;\n","An indie nuclear war reactor: a glorified steam engine is usually located in the rear portion of a sub and protected by a thick metal casing;\n","The sonar sphere, atmosphere control equipment and distilling plants.  \n","\n","Our indie rebel inc game is primarily a hardcore survival game for one player, where you’ll have to go through bomb missions. Each route is unique: somewhere near Greenland or Chernobyl, for example, enemy warships might destroy your sub armada by dropping a few depth charges while the Russian Navy will demonstrate its power in the Baltic Sea. If you get tired of naval warfare battles, you can always forget the dramas and sink in the Bahamas – no armies or nukes, dear raft commander!\n","\n","You raft in the open sea, nuclear war can start at any time, navy crewmembers are discussing the strategy… And suddenly twenty yellow submarines destroy your boat and launch dozens of ww rackets!

A good captain of any battleship should take care about sonar, nukes, energy and power, and charge the battery if necessary.\n","\n","If you want your fleet crew to breathe in fresh air instead of radioactive fallout, monitor your sonar and the level of oxygen: sometimes it’s better to float to the surface or improve your raft boat modifications so it can produce oxygen underwater.\n","\n","We need to go deeper, so, Chernobyl fallout fuel will become the icing on the cake since it won’t be possible to charge the battery without it. \n","\n","You won’t use diesel engine power – atom nuclear reactor will certainly appear in your battleship and your boat, but the whole crew will have to prove their high level of training. With such a boom weapon, an uboat and a sonar, you will be more survivable while winning your next warship battle and destroying subs fleet. But don’t cause the outbreak of ww3 or second Chernobyl with radioactive ship fallout!\n","\n","Our indie hardcore survival raft rebel inc game has several marine reactor features & boom fleet weapons that distinguish it from other army boat simulators, coz we need to go deeper: \n","\n","There are no clues, except for a short marine training during the first bomb mission. Such a tough spirit of this submarine simulator will help everyone to become a real navy seal who understands the complex structure of any battleship, warship, ship or sub.\n","\n","Four different modes - from Pearl Harbor with u boots to the outbreak of atom Chernobyl with fallout! Bombs, fleet explosions, breathtaking battles, u boots, weapons and boom! Pure arcade ww3 hardcore!\n","Once again!
